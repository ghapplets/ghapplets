            <p class="v-btm">Blueprints enable GitHub partners to build and deploy end-to-end solutions using a combination of toolchains and workflows.</p>
            <p class="mt3 v-btm">We need a solution that allows our SI partners to automate SDLC workflows based on industry vertical needs. These workflows and toolchains are currently being called blueprints inside our partner community.</p>
            <p class="mt3 v-btm">Currently, integrating GitHub Enterprise into the SDLC requires the assumption that every SDLC workflow begins on GitHub Enterprise. Our business partners see GitHub Enterprise as one of many products inside their customer's overall toolchain purchase. As GitHub Enterprise evolves into a Platform, we need a way to simplify building integrations and workflows that can establish an integrated SDLC toolchain.</p>
            <p class="mt3 v-btm">GHApplets offer a set of tools, guidelines and suggestions for GitHub Partners.</p>
            <p class="mt3 mb0 v-btm">Disclaimer: this is not a GitHub product and will not be supported by GitHub. The goal is for our SIs to perform the development and delivery of these workflows with guidance from the GitHub Partners team.</p>

          <p class="f5 lh-copy">
            Running projects that require the integration of several different components to work flawlessly is not trivial. There may be particular constraints, especially in regulated industries, that demand a higher level of customization to answer specific needs. In this example, due to strict compliance requirements Customer A needs to ensure that all work is tracked on Jira and that every pull requests in a repository need to have a matching Jira ID.
